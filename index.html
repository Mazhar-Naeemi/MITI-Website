	<h1><center>WELCOME TO MITI</center></h1>
	<p>
Memon Industrial & Technical Institute (MITI) is the leading vocational and technical training provider in Karachi. We are offering training in 60 different courses for both genders. Our courses duration is 4 months, 6 months, 1 year and short courses of 2 weeks to 2 months and 1-day proficiency classes are also offered. MITI is affiliated & accredited with the National Vocational & Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), Trade and Testing Board (TTB), Sindh, Sindh Technical Education & Vocational Training Authority (STEVTA), Sindh Board of Technical Education (SBTE).
<br>
Taking into consideration the aspirations of the community, existing workshops and labs were expanded in 2012 to cater to increasing student strength, and classes were extended into three shifts Morning, Afternoon, and Evening so that more people could gain the benefit of skillful training. And currently, we are graduating 1500-1800 males and 3000-3500 females in each batch which is increasing day by day. The passed out graduates are more than 1 Lac & awarded with the certificates of achievement.
<br>
Initially, our focus areas were Landhi Korangi, Shah-Faisal Colony, and Malir. This has now expanded to many more towns and currently, we are serving the youth from all over Karachi with no discrimination of caste and creed.
<br>
As MITI remains focused on charitable work so its fee structure is highly subsidized and most affordable. Besides such an economical fee, MITI is also offering scholarships for the needy and deserving students so that no person remains unskilled and deprived.
<br>
In the future, MITI plans to open more courses for which there is a growing demand in the market and industry and prides in becoming a premier institute not only in Karachi but in the country as the management and staff are committed to its continued growth and rapid advancement. We are blessed to be among the pioneers in technical and vocational training. More than 80,000 graduates of MITI are in society who have secured employment and are self-employed entrepreneurs too. We are highly grateful to Allah SWT for guiding us in the right direction and giving us success in our venture.</p>
